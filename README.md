## 📍 Overview

This project provides a generic menu-based interface for various data structures implemented in C++. Users can choose from a selection of data structures and perform operations such as insertion, deletion, traversal, and more.

---

## 🛠️ Features

- **Dynamic Menu:** Users are presented with a dynamic menu to choose the desired data structure.
- **User Interaction:** The program prompts users to select operations like insertion, deletion, traversal, etc., depending on the chosen data structure.
- **Generic Implementation:** The code is designed to work with different data types, enabling users to store and manipulate various types of data.
- **Error Handling:** Proper error handling mechanisms are implemented to handle edge cases and invalid user inputs.
- **Modular Design:** Each data structure is implemented in a modular fashion, allowing for easy modification or expansion of functionality.
- **Memory Management:** The program ensures proper memory allocation and deallocation to prevent memory leaks and optimize resource usage.

---

## 🔧 Usage

1. **Compilation:** Compile the program using any C++ compiler.
   ```bash
   g++ main.cpp -o data_structures
2.**Execution:** Run the compiled executable.
  ./data_structures
3. **Data Structure Selection:** Choose a data structure from the menu by entering the corresponding number.
4. **Operations:** Follow the prompts to perform various operations on the selected data structure.
